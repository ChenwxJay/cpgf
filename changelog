TBD version 1.2.5
	In meta method, constructor and object functor operator, support parameters default value.

2012-01-28 version 1.2.4
	Added meta data for OpenGL, GLU, and GLUT.
	Added binary data support (via IByteArray) in script binding.
	Added a sample application to show how to use OpenGL in Lua and V8 Javascript.
	Extended meta enum to accept a GVariant. Now meta enum can be not only integer, but also float, pointer, string, etc. Useful to reflect constants.
	Fixed a bug in V8 binding that enum value can't be accessed through class.

2012-01-24 version 1.2.3
	Added script function wrapper. Now script can pass script function to C++ as method parameters.
	Added script object wrapper. Now script can pass script object to C++ as method parameters.
	Added meta data for STL iterator, vector, list and deque.
	V8 binding -- Added object property enumerator. Now using for..in will enumerate all meta data in the object.
	Added policy GMetaRuleGetterExplicitThis and GMetaRuleSetterExplicitThis for property getter and setter.
	Added vtInterface in GVariant.
	Improved code portability, now the library can compile in Intel C++ Compiler Composer XE and Embarcadero C++ Builder 2010.
	Fixed a bug that in script binding, if a method returns GVariant, the result will be wrongly converted to an object.

2012-01-07 version 1.2.2
	Added meta policy GMetaRuleExplicitThis.
	Support binding object functor as meta method.
	Support C++0x/C++11 rvalue reference in variant, callback and reflection.
	Support return reference to fundamental from script function. (Pass by value instead of reference)
	Renamed GDefineMetaClass::inner to GDefineMetaClass::declare.
	Now the meta class created by GDefineMetaClass::declare can be freed automatically if it's not added to other class.
	Refactored to make script binding less dependence on static variables.
	Fixed a bug that can't cast a variant with fundamental to const T &.
	Fixed a bug that crash when return unbound nested class from member function in V8 binding.

2011-12-18 version 1.2.1
	Fixed the code compatibility. Now the library can be compiled by GCC 3.4.2. (Tested with MingW GCC).
	Remove a type casting between void * and function pointer in gcallback. Now the library is more compatible with C++ standard.
	Added xcode project generating in CMake build.

2011-12-17 version 1.2.0
	Added new meta data definition syntax. Now no macro is required to build the meta data.
	Added bindAccessible in script binding.
	Removed gmetareflect .h and .cpp, which was macro based meta data reflection.

2011-12-10 version 1.1.0
	Added Google V8 Javascript engine binding.
	Added non-meta data support in script binding. The script can use arbitrary data type. (void *, T *, while T is not reflected).
	Added second parameter "void ** outInstance" to function GScriptObject::getMethod
	Refactored unit tests of script binding.
	Added unit tests for script binding of Lua and V8.
	Removed GScriptName and changed all name type to const char *
	Fixed a memory bug that cause binding engine wrong references to GScriptConfig on the stack.
	Fixed memory leak in GScopedInterface when call "reset" with same pointer.
	Fixed a bug that can't access a member object's member in script binding. (a.b.c = 1 will cause a.b be copied, now a.b is referenced)

2011-11-27 version 1.0.1
	Refactored Lua binding, using better and faster algorithm to travel for data and methods.
	Distinguish static and member data access in Lua binding.
	Add: class GMetaClassTraveller in gmetaclasstraveller.h to ease iterating class hierarchy.
	Add: function gdynamic_cast in gglobal.h for safe and fast dynamic cast.
	Add: unit tests test_lua_basic.cpp, test_lua_operator.cpp, test_lua_hierarchy.cpp
	Bug fix: binding Lua operators to wrong meta table.
	Bug fix: Lua passes two parameters to __unm operator that cpgf doesn't handle correctly.
	Bug fix: some exceptions raised by interface API were not detected in Lua binding. Now re-throw it to Lua.
	Memory leak fix: leak when exception is raised during any Lua callback.
	Remove: function getMethodList and getMethodListInHierarchy from GMetaClass and IMetaClass. They were replaced with better algorithm.
	Remove: error output to stderr in Lua binding.
	Add separate license file.

2011-11-05 version 1.0.0
	First release.
