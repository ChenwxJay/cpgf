<h1>cpgf script binding -- an open source library to create binding between C++ and Lua script engine</h1>

cpgf script binding library is very easy use to bind between C++ and Lua.<br />
The library uses reflection meta data extensively.<br />
<br />
cpgf script binding is licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0<br />
<br />
The supported Lua library is 5.1<br />
<br />

<h3>Key features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bind C++ class to Lua. Then Lua script can create instance, invoke class member function, get/set class field and more.
</li><li>Bind C++ enum type to Lua. Then Lua script can access the enum value by name.
</li><li>Bind C++ functions (global or member) to Lua.
</li><li>Bind C++ values to Lua variable.
</li><li>The overloaded operators in C++ are bound to Lua together with the class.
</li><li>Invoke Lua functions from C++.
</li><li>Get and set Lua value from C++.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Lua binding is only the very beginning!</h3>

Lua binding is only the first script binding library introduced to cpgf script library.<br />
With the powerful reflection, we can add arbitrary script binding quite easily.<br />
<br />
My next plan is to bring JavaScript binding to cpgf. Maybe Google V8 is an candidate.<br />
<br />
All script binding engines will use the same interface -- GScriptObject and IScriptObject, and use same meta data.<br />
