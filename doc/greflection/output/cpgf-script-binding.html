<h1>cpgf script binding -- an open source library to bind Lua and Google V8 Javascript to C++ </h1>

cpgf script binding library is very easy script binding engine to bind Lua and Google V8 Javascript to C++.<br />
The library uses reflection meta data extensively.<br />
<br />
cpgf script binding is licensed under Apache License, Version 2.0<br />
<br />
The supported Lua library is version 5.1<br />
The supported Google V8 Javascript library is Version 3.4.5<br />
<br />

<h3>Key features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Bind C++ class to Lua and Google V8 Javascript. Then Lua and Javascript can create instance, invoke class member function, get/set class field or property, and more.
</li><li>Bind C++ enum type to Lua and V8 Javascript. Then Lua and Javascript can access the enum value by name.
</li><li>Bind C++ functions (global or member) to Lua and V8.
</li><li>Bind C++ values to Lua and V8 variable.
</li><li>Bind C++ operators to Lua (Lua only). The overloaded operators in C++ are bound to Lua together with the class.
</li><li>Invoke Lua and V8 Javascript functions from C++.
</li><li>Get and set Lua and V8 Javascript value from C++.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Different script language, same API interface!</h3>

<br />
Though there is very big difference in internal implementation and public API between Lua and Google V8 Javascript, cpgf makes the binding exactly the same.<br />
We use same data, the reflection meta data, to drive the binding.<br />
We use same API, only the interface of classes GScriptObject and IScriptObject, to make the binding.<br />
<br />
What does that mean?<br />
It means <b>write your C++ code once, binding to any script languages -- now supported Lua and V8 Javascript, on any platforms -- Windows, Linux, Mac, VC, gcc, XCode.</b><br />
