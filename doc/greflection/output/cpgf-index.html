<h1>cpgf library -- a free C++ open source library for reflection, script binding, callbacks</h1>

cpgf is a free, open source and cross platform C++ library.<br />
cpgf is composed by several independent libraries:<br />
<ul><li>	cpgf reflection -- a library to add	reflection feature to C++.
</li>	
<li>	cpgf script binding -- a script binding engine to bind Lua and Google V8 Javascript to C++. It's based on the reflection library.
</li>	
<li>	cpgf callback -- a callback library to implement signal/slot or callback in C++. It's the primary library for other libraries.
</li></ul>The goal of cpgf is to extend C++ language with a lot of easy to use features which are only available in other higher level languages and absence in C++.<br />
cpgf provides a very easy to use callback system, which is common used in C# and script languages.<br />
cpgf provides a powerful reflection and meta data system. Ever envy the reflection system in C# and Java? now we have it in C++!<br />
cpgf makes binding Lua and Google V8 to C++ a piece of cake! The script binding engine uses the reflection system extensively.<br />
<br />
<b>Vesion 1.2.0 is released on Dec.17, 2011. </b><br />
<br />

<h3>Key features</h3>
<ul><li>	<b>Provide easy to use class and function based library. </b>
</li>
<li>	<b>Also provide interface based, Windows COM style, binary compatible API. </b> It's easy to put meta data in a dynamic library and use the meta data from within another library.
</li>
<li>	<b>Written in (almost) standard and portable C++. </b> It can be compiled at least under VC and GCC, on Windows, Linux, and Mac.
</li>
<li>	<b>Extensively, but not abuse, using template programming. </b> Don't feel scaring. The compile time is not slow!
</li>	
<li>	<b>No need external preprocessor or code generation tools. </b> Just coding and enjoy. Easy to setup, easy to integrate with your project.
</li>	
<li>	<b>Free and open source. </b>
</li></ul>

<h3>Quick facts of reflection library</h3>
<ul><li>	Almost as powerful as the reflection system in Java and C#.
</li><li>	Reflect global/member functions, global/member fields (variable), global/member properties (fields with getter/setter), constructors, classes, enumerators, and annotations.
</li><li>	Real runtime reflection. No template parameters are needed.
</li><li>	No external preprocessor required, no ugly macros. Only using C++ templates, classes, and functions.
</li><li>	Support multiple inheritance.
</li><li>	For more information, please read cpgf reflection related documentation.
</li></ul>
<h3>Quick facts of script binding library</h3>
<ul><li>	Bind C++ classes, enumerators, functions, variables and operators to Lua and Google V8 Javascript.
</li><li>	Invoke Lua and V8 Javascript functions from C++.
</li><li>	Get and set Lua and V8 Javascript variables from C++.
</li><li>	For more information, please read cpgf script binding related documentation.
</li></ul>

<h3>Required third party library -- None for the major libraries </h3>
	Doesn't require C++0X and TR1 features.<br />
	Doesn't require Boost library.<br />
	For Lua binding, Lua library is required.<br />
	For Google V8 Javascript binding, V8 library is required.<br />
	If you want to run the unit test, UnitTest++ is required. But usually you don't need to do that.<br />
	<br />
	

<h3>Learning the library </h3>
	Though there are some documentations on this website, they are far from good.<br />
	They are incomplete, and not quite native reading.<br />
<br />
	The fastest way to get start with the library is to read the sample code<br />
	in the folder &quot;samples&quot;.<br />
	The sample code was originally written for test purpose, so they are not<br />
	as easy to read as you expect. But they covers most features so it's<br />
	a good kick off.<br />
	<br />
	If you want to read more sample code, read the code in the folder &quot;test&quot;.<br />
	They are for unit test. They are much more difficult to read and<br />
	use a lot of macros.<br />
	However, they cover much more functions than the sample code.<br />
	<br />
	
<h3>How is the library tested </h3>
	Several measures are adopted to test the library.<br />
	Unit test -- hundreds of unit tests were written and ran. More unit tests are being added for existing code and new code.<br />
	Valgrind -- valgrind is used to check memory leaks and other memory problems (wild pointer, double free, etc).<br />
	Code coverage -- GNU gcov is used to check the code coverage in unit tests. The ultimate goal is to cover all API functions and 80% implementation code. Though we didn't achieve the goal yet, we are closing to it day by day.<br />
	<br />

<h3>Contribute to the library </h3>
	If you like the library and want to contribute to it, here are some most desired work to do<br />
	1, Use the library in your real project. That will help the library much. A library is nothing without real projects using it.<br />
	2, Help with the documentation. I'm not a native English speaker, and I also don't enjoy writing documentation.<br />
	3, Test the library on more compilers and platforms.<br />
	<br />

<h3>What does cpgf mean? </h3>
	The original cpgf means Cross Platform Game Framework.<br />
	It was intended	to be game framework that can work on PC and smart phone.<br />
	But later I decided to add more fun but non-game features to the library.<br />
	So now the library is neither for game nor a framework.<br />
	It's a cross platform C++ library.<br />
	<br />
