<h3>2011-12-10 version 1.1.0 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Added Google V8 Javascript engine binding.
	Added non-meta data support in script binding. The script can use arbitrary data type. (void *, T *, while T is not reflected).
	Added second parameter "void ** outInstance" to function GScriptObject::getMethod
	Refactored unit tests of script binding.
	Added unit tests for script binding of Lua and V8.
	Removed GScriptName and changed all name type to const char *
	Fixed a memory bug that cause binding engine wrong references to GScriptConfig on the stack.
	Fixed memory leak in GScopedInterface when call "reset" with same pointer.
	Fixed a bug that can't access a member object's member in script binding. (a.b.c = 1 will cause a.b be copied, now a.b is referenced)

<h3>2011-11-27 version 1.0.1 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Refactored Lua binding, using better and faster algorithm to travel for data and methods.
	Distinguish static and member data access in Lua binding.
	Add: class GMetaClassTraveller in gmetaclasstraveller.h to ease iterating class hierarchy.
	Add: function gdynamic_cast in gglobal.h for safe and fast dynamic cast.
	Add: unit tests test_lua_basic.cpp, test_lua_operator.cpp, test_lua_hierarchy.cpp
	Bug fix: binding Lua operators to wrong meta table.
	Bug fix: Lua passes two parameters to __unm operator that cpgf doesn't handle correctly.
	Bug fix: some exceptions raised by interface API were not detected in Lua binding. Now re-throw it to Lua.
	Memory leak fix: leak when exception is raised during any Lua callback.
	Remove: function getMethodList and getMethodListInHierarchy from GMetaClass and IMetaClass. They were replaced with better algorithm.
	Remove: error output to stderr in Lua binding.
	Add separate license file.
