<h1>cpgf library changes log</h1>

<h3>2011-12-18 version 1.2.1 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Fixed the code compatibility. Now the library can be compiled by GCC 3.4.2. (Tested with MingW GCC).
	Remove a type casting between void * and function pointer in gcallback. Now the library is more compatible with C++ standard.
	Added xcode project generating in CMake build.
<{/autoul}>

<h3>2011-12-17 version 1.2.0 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Added new meta data definition syntax. Now no macro is required to build the meta data.
	Added bindAccessible in script binding.
	Removed gmetareflect .h and .cpp, which was macro based meta data reflection.
<{/autoul}>

<h3>2011-12-10 version 1.1.0 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Added Google V8 Javascript engine binding.
	Added non-meta data support in script binding. The script can use arbitrary data type. (void *, T *, while T is not reflected).
	Added second parameter "void ** outInstance" to function GScriptObject::getMethod
	Refactored unit tests of script binding.
	Added unit tests for script binding of Lua and V8.
	Removed GScriptName and changed all name type to const char *
	Fixed a memory bug that cause binding engine wrong references to GScriptConfig on the stack.
	Fixed memory leak in GScopedInterface when call "reset" with same pointer.
	Fixed a bug that can't access a member object's member in script binding. (a.b.c = 1 will cause a.b be copied, now a.b is referenced)
<{/autoul}>

<h3>2011-11-27 version 1.0.1 </h3>
<{autoul}>
	Refactored Lua binding, using better and faster algorithm to travel for data and methods.
	Distinguish static and member data access in Lua binding.
	Add: class GMetaClassTraveller in gmetaclasstraveller.h to ease iterating class hierarchy.
	Add: function gdynamic_cast in gglobal.h for safe and fast dynamic cast.
	Add: unit tests test_lua_basic.cpp, test_lua_operator.cpp, test_lua_hierarchy.cpp
	Bug fix: binding Lua operators to wrong meta table.
	Bug fix: Lua passes two parameters to __unm operator that cpgf doesn't handle correctly.
	Bug fix: some exceptions raised by interface API were not detected in Lua binding. Now re-throw it to Lua.
	Memory leak fix: leak when exception is raised during any Lua callback.
	Remove: function getMethodList and getMethodListInHierarchy from GMetaClass and IMetaClass. They were replaced with better algorithm.
	Remove: error output to stderr in Lua binding.
	Add separate license file.
