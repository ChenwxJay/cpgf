<{sh}> Some of the library document is bad, I want to help to rephrase it, but how can I help?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
First, any intention of helping the library is appreciated.
Second, about the documentation.
I wrote a script to parse my own defined document format to create the document.
So it's hard for anyone else to edit the document source file directly unless you want to learn my own format.

To help to improve the document, you just need to copy the paragraph, or the whole text, from the web page, edit it in a text editor, then send the revision back to me by email.
You can find my gmail address in the About page.

Note: you can only help to improve the content, not the format.

<{sgroup}> Script binding (Lua and Google V8 Javascript)

<{sh}> When should I use bindMethod and bindMethodList?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
If you are only binding classes, never you need to call bindMethod or bindMethodList.
cpgf will bind all class members automatically.

bindMethod and bindMethodList are useful if you want to bind methods to global scope under current script object.

<{sh}> How can I pass script function and object from script to C++?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
It's quite common to define some functions and objects in the script and let C++ code use them.
You can't pass the function or object directly, because in C++ there is no type of script function and object.
However, you can pass the function and object name to C++, then the C++ can invoke the script function, or get the script object.
