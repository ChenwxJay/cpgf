<{sgroup}> Script binding (Lua and Google V8 Javascript)

<{sh}> When should I use bindMethod and bindMethodList?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
If you are only binding classes, never you need to call bindMethod or bindMethodList.
cpgf will bind all class members automatically.

bindMethod and bindMethodList are useful if you want to bind methods to global scope under current script object.

<{sh}> Why can't I bind meta field and property?
<{sc}>

<{autobr}>
The fields and properties in a meta class will be automatically bound.
But we can't bind fields or properties to a script object directly.
In Google V8, it's possible, but in Lua, seems it's not possible because we can't set callback for that.
If you know how to bind variable with getter and setter in Lua, let me known.

So to keep the API interface consisten, we don't support fields and properties binding.
