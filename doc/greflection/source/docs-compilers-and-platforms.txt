<h3>cgpf library portability and compatibility -- tested supported C++ compilers and platforms</h3>

<{autobr}>

Below table shows the tested platforms and C++ compilers that cpgf works on.
In summary, if you are working on Microsoft Windows, Linux, MacOS, and using the compilers MS VC 2008 or newer, GCC 3.4.2 or newer, cpgf library will work for you.
And your target platform is not limited to Windows, Linux or Mac. It can be mobile phones, embeded deviced, game consoles, as long as it has a compiler supported in the list.

From version 1.2.3, cpgf also supports Embarcadero C++ Builder (tested with version 2010).

<{autobr}>
Note: script binding library can be compiled but doesn't link, because it's not trivial work to get C++ Buidler work with Lua and Google V8 library.
Some unit tests will cause "E2491 Maximum VIRDEF count exceeded" error, or internal error.
That's because of that the compiler is buggy and lame.

<b>Notes: </b>

<b>"Compile clean" means succeeding the compiling and linking, no errors or warnings after enabling all warnings. </b>
Google V8 v8.h will introduce warnings but that's not counted to cpgf.

<b>The working compilers and platforms are not limited to the list in the table. </b>
The table only shows the compilers and platforms that were tested.
The newer version compilers and platforms should work well too.

<b>Your help is wanted. </b>
If you approve that cpgf library works on other compilers or platforms, please let me know!
Especially non-VC and non-gcc compilers are interested, such as Intel compiler.
Also non-Windows, non-Linux and non-Mac platforms are interested, such as mobile phones, game consoles (Wii, WiiU, NDS, 3DS, XBox 360, PS3, PSP), or embeded system.
Also more 64 bit tests are interested.
