<{autobr}>
The cpgf library exposes two kind of programming interfaces.
One is called "library".
The other is called "API".

For library, all interfaces are exposed by the classes directly.
With this approach, the application binary interface (ABI) is not guaranteed to be compatible cross compilers and platforms.

For API, all interfaces are exposed by Windows COM style interfaces (abstract classes).
With this approach, the application binary interface (ABI) is guaranteed to be compatible cross compilers and platforms.
