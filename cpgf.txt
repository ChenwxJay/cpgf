Todo:

1, Support ExplicitThis policy for property getter and setter separately.
2, Support script function callback (wrap to object).
3, Need to test setting script function as property.
3, Test with Lua 5.2
2, In v8, support property enumerator.
1, GVariant passes rvalue reference as value, not efficient, should imporve.
2, Support default parameter values in meta method
3, Define meta data for STL
4, Define meta data for C library?

Done:
1, in V8, should remove the static user data pool.
1, Support name replacer in meta data builder
2, Support explicit this in property getter and setter.
1, callback can't work with rvalue reference
2, Support bindAccessible in Lua binding
3, Better meta class definition syntax. Something like,
defineMetaClass(...)
	.method(...)
	.field(...)
	.property(...)
	.end()
